## Installation

### Linux + MacOS + Termux

Install using [this shell script](https://github.com/metafates/mangal/blob/main/scripts/install)

```shell
curl -sfL io.metafates.one/mi | sh
```

This script will automatically detect OS & Distro and use the best option available.
For example, on macOS it will try to use Homebrew, on Ubuntu it will install the `.deb` package and so on...

> Termux support is limited to downloading manga only.
> You can't read chapters or use headless chrome based scrapers

## Configuration

Mangal uses [TOML](https://toml.io) format for configuration under the `mangal.toml` filename.
Config path depends on the OS.
To find yours, use `mangal where --config`.
For example, on __Linux__ it would be `~/.config/mangal/mangal.toml`.

Use env variable `MANGAL_CONFIG_PATH` to set custom config path.
> See `mangal env` to show all available env variables.

Run `mangal where` to show expected config paths

Run `mangal config init` to generate a default config file

## Custom scrapers

TLDR; To browse and install a custom scraper
from [mangal-scrapers repository](https://github.com/metafates/mangal-scrapers) run

    mangal install

Mangal has a Lua5.1 VM built-in + some useful libraries, such as headless chrome, http client, html parser and so on...

Check the [defined modules](luamodules) for more information.

For scraper examples, check the [mangal-scrapers repository](https://github.com/metafates/mangal-scrapers)

### Creating a custom scraper

This command will create `example.lua` file in the `mangal where --sources` directory.

    mangal gen --name example --url https://example.com

Open the file and edit it as you wish.
Take a look at the comments for more information.
See [mangal-scrapers repository](https://github.com/metafates/mangal-scrapers) for examples.

You can test it by running `mangal run <filepath>`

It should automatically appear in the list of available scrapers.

## Anilist

Mangal also supports integration with anilist.

It will mark chapters as read on Anilsit when you read them inside mangal.

For more information see [wiki](https://github.com/metafates/mangal/wiki/Anilist-Integration)

> Maybe I'll add more sites in the future, like [myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net/). Open for suggestions!
