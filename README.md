## About

‚ú® __Mangal__ is a fancy TUI app written in go that scrapes, downloads and packs manga into pdfs

‚öôÔ∏è The most important feature of Mangal is that it supports user defined scrapers
that can be added with just a few lines of config file (see [limitations](#limitations))

üßã Built with [Bubble Tea framework](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)

üçø This app is inspired by __awesome__ [ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli). Check it out!

## Examples

<h3 align="center">Usage example</h3>

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62389790/172178993-bb40392a-54ba-446d-b0ed-1b962ede7ed2.mp4


<h3 align="center">Config example</h3>

Config is located at the OS default config directory.

- __Unix__ - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mangal/config.toml` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` exists, else `$HOME/.config/mangal/config.toml`
- __Darwin__ (macOS) - `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/mangal/config.toml`
- __Windows__ - `%AppData%\mangal\config.toml`
- __Plan 9__ - `$home/lib/mangal/config.toml`

You can load config from custom path by using `--config` flag

`mangal --config /user/configs/config.toml`

By default, Mangal uses [manganelo](https://ww5.manganelo.tv) as a source

```toml
# Which sources to use. You can use several sources in descendant order priority
use = ['manganelo']

# Default download path
path = '.'

# Fullscreen mode
fullscreen = true

[sources]
    [sources.manganelo]
    # Base url
    base = 'https://ww5.manganelo.tv'

    # Search endpoint. Put %s where the query should be
    search = 'https://ww5.manganelo.tv/search/%s'

    # Selector of entry anchor (<a></a>) on search page
    manga_anchor = '.search-story-item a.item-title'

    # Selector of entry title on search page
    manga_title = '.search-story-item a.item-title'

    # Manga chapters anchors selector
    chapter_anchor = 'li.a-h a.chapter-name'

    # Manga chapters titles selector
    chapter_title = 'li.a-h a.chapter-name'

    # Reader page images selector
    reader_page = '.container-chapter-reader img'
    
    # Random delay between requests (in miliseconds)
    random_delay_ms = 500
    
    # Are chapters listed in reversed order on that source?
    # reversed = from latest to oldest
    reversed_chapters_order = true

```

## Limitations

Even though most manga sites will work, there exists some limitation to which sites could be added

- Navigation layout should follow this model
    - Each manga have a separate page
    - Manga page should have a some form of chapters list (not lazy loaded)
    - Each chapter should have a separate page with pages (images)

<br>

Some sites that work well

- https://manganato.com
- https://ww3.mangakakalot.tv
- https://ww5.manganelo.tv
